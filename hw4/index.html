<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Overall, the project was fun and a nice refresher from hw3. The resulting cloth created ends up being fairly realistic or 
  at least believable, and this shows the versatility of using springs and masses to simulate physical objects. My least favorite 
  part of the project was part 5, because it just felt like some evil way to bring back up the trauma from project 3. Overall, the 
  project was fun I guess.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
<p>
  To build the grid, I looped through all the num_width_points and num_heigh_points to build each point in the grid. 
  If the orientation is horizontal, for each x and z index, I calculated the position of the point mass to be added by multiplying it 
  by the size of the horizontal or vertical steps in each direction, which equals width/(num_width_points-1) and height/(num_height_points-1), 
  respesctively. I had to subtract one for the step size because we want a point to be exactly at 0 and at the width and height coordinates. For each 
  point, after finding the coordinates, I made a new point mass and set pinned to be true if the point is in the pinned vector. Then, I added the point 
  to point_masses. For vertical orientations, the process is mostly the same, except this time we are finding the x and y coordinates instead of x and z coordinates, 
  so the step size for z would instead be the step size for y.
</p>
<p>
  Then, once the point masses were made, I loop through all of them again, except this time adding springs along the way. I loop through the num_height_points and num_width_points in the 
  same way, so at each step I have the height and width indexes of a particular point. From that point, I check if the current position isn't on an edge (eg if w>0 for structural springs) for 
  each spring type, and then try to add each spring type to every mass. For shearing and bending springs, we do have to check in both directions, but the process to check and add springs is pretty 
  much copy and paste for all spring types. For each spring, we make sure to add it to the springs vector. After that, we are done with the grid!

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
<p>
  By changing the spring constant, we can make the cloth a lot more droopy or stiff, for low and high spring constants, 
  respecitvely. See how in the high spring constant example, the cloth almost looks like a solid board, but in the low spring 
  constant example, the cloth just droops down.

  <br>
  <p>
    For low density values, the cloth droops down less and has less creases, probably because generally springs are 
    less loaded so the springs are overall nearer to their resting state. For high density, the cloth droops down more and 
    many of the springs are stretched to their max, which is why there are a lot more sharp creases.

      For high and low damping values, the final result looks about the same as the default settings, but when the cloth is 
      dropping, the low damping lags a lot and overall has way more bumps and is much more detailed. For high damping, when the cloth 
      drops down, it's almost like a flat board with not much detail, but it runs faster.

  <h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  <p>
    For sphere collisions, I first check if a point mass's position is inside the sphere by checking if the distance between it and 
    the sphere's center is less than the radius of the sphere. If it is, then I find where the point should be if it were to collide on the surface 
    of the sphere, then find the vector going from the last position of the point to that position, then add that vector to the last position, scaled down by friction. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For plane collisions, the idea is similar. I first check of the last position of the point and the current position are on different sides of the plane by using 
    the dot product of a point on the plane and the given position, and seeing if the result is positive or negative. Then, if the two positions are on different sides of the plane, I 
    find where the point would have collided with the plane by using the ray intersection equation using the last position as the origin and the vector from the last position to current position as d. 
    I then set the new position as the last position plus d times t, where t would lead to the plane collision, scaled down by friction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The differences in ks changes how the cloth behaves. For higher ks, the springs are more stiff, so the cloth itself 
    is more stiff, and ends up bending over less over the round edges of the sphere. For low ks, the cloth is less stiff and 
    more bendy, and so the cloth ends up draping around the sphere more and hugs the sphere more closely. The lower the spring 
    constant, the more frilly the edges of the cloth looks as the cloth bends into more curves when the spring constant is lower.

<p>Here are some results with a higher spring constant, ks=50000. Notice how the cloth doesn't want to bend as much as doesn't 
  make bends as sharp, which causes the cloth to ultimately settle being less folded and also having less bumps in the cloth itself.

    Here are the results of using a low ks, ks=500. Notice how the cloth bends a lot more when it's falling, and also has much more bumps that ripple through 
    as it falls. When it settles, it also has a shape that is more complex with more bumps and folds. The cloth also doesn't want to settle, still bouncing around and lagging 
    a while after falling. The low ks reminds me of how it's like using low damping, with the cloth having more overall action and detail as it falls.

      Here is the cloth falling with high density, 150g/cm^2. The cloth behaves similarly to having low spring constant, 
      as when the cloth falls its high density overwhelms the springs, causing the bottom to fold in on itself a lot. The difference is that 
      as the cloth is falling, when the bottom half is starting to get folded, the top still looks relatively unaffected. This is kind of like how it looks 
      when they demolish buildings and blow up the base, causing the building to seemingly just fall straight down into the ground. As it falls, the bottom 
      of the cloth just collapses into itself just like that.

  <h2 align="middle">Part V: Cloth Sim</h2>
  <p>For shaders, we use OpenGL so we can access the powers of the GPU when rendering realistic lighting. To do this, we use both vertex and fragment shaders, which 
    are written in GLSL, a C-like language. Vertex shaders take in things like a vertex's position, texel, and normal, and output similar things to the fragment shader. The 
    key here is that the vertex shader also sets gl_Position, where is where the vertex would actually be rasterized on the screen. This is important because changing this allows us 
    to do displacement mapping, which requires changing the position of vertices to create visible bumps. The fragment shader then takes in all the information about a given vertex from the 
    vertex shader, and computes the final output color using that information, taking into account things such as lighting and angles. So in the end, these two things work together, with the vertex 
    shader computing the geometric properties of the vertex, such as its position, and the fragment shader computing its final output color.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phong shading is a shading model that takes into account three things: diffuse lighting, spectral highlights, and ambient lighting. Diffuse lighting is what gives object its matte appearance, and mainly 
    only depends on the total average light coming into a certain area. Thus, the same location would have the same diffuse lighting no matter which angle you look at it from. Spectral highlights are like the glossy 
    reflections of a surface, usually being very bright and mostly white. These depend on the angle you view the object from, unlike diffuse lighting. Finally, ambient lighting in the Phong model is just a constant light 
    that is added to everything so that shadows aren't completely pitch black. Here are screenshots of the sphere with different aspects of the blinn-phong model:
